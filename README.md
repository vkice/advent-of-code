# vkice - Advent Of Code

Solutions I've written for days of Advent of Code, retaining the final solutions when modifying as instructed by Part 2

Likely all Python scripts, written without assistance aside from researching API and packages that aid in coming up with the solutions

My goal is to have fun and be creative, not intended to be the most efficient or prettiest solutions
